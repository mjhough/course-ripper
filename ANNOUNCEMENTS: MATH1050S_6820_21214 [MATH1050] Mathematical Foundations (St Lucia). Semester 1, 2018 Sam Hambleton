Learning pathway dates
Posted on: Tuesday, 6 March 2018 10:14:34 AM AEST
Hello Math1050 students, Please ignore all dates found in the "Learning Pathways" area. These are old and invalid. The only valid dates are in the ECP. This will always be the case for UQ courses that the ECP is the version of things that we stick to. I didn't want to delete the learning pathway stuff because it looks fairly useful. However, the dates there are incorrect.

As discussed in our last lecture, we will omit some questions at the end of the second assignment. The revised version of this is now in the assessment folder. The due date is unchanged.

Mid-Semester Exam Info
Posted on: Thursday, 5 April 2018 11:37:07 AM AEST
I hope you are enjoying your break students. As you probably know, your mid-semester exam (unless you have an official alternative circumstances approval) will be on Saturday evening the 28th of April, 2018 at 4:30 pm. Please be there 15 minutes early. This will be a 90 minute exam with 10 min. reading so you may not be out of the room until around 6:20 pm so don't make plans for a 6 pm celebration. I have constructed this exam and I think you will find it challenging. I will go over a past mid-semester exam some time before your mid-sem exam and some additional problems to ensure you have learned what I want you to learn. I expect you to study hard so please do not disappoint me.

Assignment 3
Posted on: Friday, 6 April 2018 1:18:34 PM AEST
Students, 
Assignment 3 is now available for you to begin. At first glance, you may be concerned about a couple of things; the due date being so close to the mid-semester exam, and the number of questions on it. Before you become alarmed, notice that there is no new content on it but rather it is assessed mid-semester exam practice. Master these questions, as doing so will certainly improve your success on the mid-semester exam. Good luck and enjoy!

If you have a Monday tutorial
Posted on: Monday, 30 April 2018 1:04:24 PM AEST
Dear students who normally have their tutorial on Mondays, 
Monday the 7th of May is a public holiday in Week 10. The quiz that would have been in that session will be conducted in the tutorial in Week 11 instead. 
I know you are probably keen for more assessment ASAP, but you'll have to wait another week for that.

Contact Session this afternoon
Posted on: Thursday, 10 May 2018 3:04:56 PM AEST
Students,
Patrick just informed me that he is going on strike today. If you were planning to attend his contact session this afternoon, it is canceled. I am in my office for the usual consultation from 3 to 4. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to come by.

Extra Problems
Posted on: Monday, 21 May 2018 3:07:13 PM AEST
Students,
I have prepared a small booklet with problems I will cover after we have completed the course content either this week or next. You may like to print a copy to facilitate your notes/study during the final lectures and SLT sessions. I uploaded the pdf to the bottom of the learning resources folder. Note that I will also continue working through these problems in the support learning tutorials on Wed 4-5 pm in 07-234. Feel free to join us in those remaining sessions also.

Consultation help from Sam
Posted on: Friday, 8 June 2018 11:01:58 AM AEST
Hello students,
I hope your study is going well. I would like to let you know that I am still happy to answer your questions during my consultation times. These are Thursdays and Fridays 2 to 4 pm in 67-756. Also, the first year learning centre people will be happy to answer your questions also. I thought these were daily from 2 to 4 on level 6 of maths but I will need to get more info on that.

Examinable content
Posted on: Tuesday, 12 June 2018 9:54:23 AM AEST
Students,
I hope your study time has been productive so far. Some are asking what content is examinable. The answer is that all content is examinable. In particular, those core skills that you must learn in order to pass the course (getting 80% on Part a) : many of these skills are those we learned in the first half of the course. Matrices and vectors are included also. Can you calculate sin (pi/ 3) ? Can you calculate a dot product and cross product? Can you rationalise denominators? Can you calculate compound interest? Can you use the chain rule and product rule? Can you carry out a simple integral? These are all important mathematical foundations that you must know. Good luck!

Support Learning Tutorials
Posted on: Thursday, 12 April 2018 11:08:40 AM AEST
Students,
I am pleased to announce that I can now offer the Support Learning Tutorials. These are usually reserved for students who have previously failed MATH1050. However, I would like to offer a welcome to all MATH1050 students. If you have previously failed MATH1050, please ask plenty of questions. What will happen in these sessions: I will bring in some past exams and do them with you under the doc cam and encourage discussion. If I run out of exams, I'll make up some problems. Will they be recorded: Not that I know of; I don't know how to organize that just yet since lectures are automatically recorded by the uni. However, if I can learn how, then sure. Where and when: Physics building 07-234. It is a large lecture room so it should accommodate most enrolled. When: this is the bad news; 4-5 pm on Wed. afternoons. Unfortunately there aren't many suitable times for all of us when a large room is also available. How long will these sessions go: Weeks 7 to 13 inclusive, except for Week 8 because it is a public holiday. 
I hope to see you all there on Wed. the 18th!
